        "\n",
        "⦁ Most of the dataset is complete, with missing values present in only a few columns.\n",
        "\n",
        "⦁ The columns Region, Category, Units Sold, and Unit Price each contain 10 missing values.\n",

        "⦁ For categorical columns (Region, Category), mode imputation or assigning appropriate category values can be used.\n",
        "\n",
        "⦁ For numerical columns (Units Sold, Unit Price), mean or median imputation can be applied.\n",
